                <p>Private sale of homes is becoming more common these days. People are choosing the option to sell
                    their home by themself and are saving a lot of money.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4><b>Why buy homes on private home sales?</b></h4>

                As a buyer on the private sale, you have direct contact with the owners who possess all the ready
                facts, information, and history of the home. By contrast, real estate agents often are unable to
                answer all your questions. For example, What exactly has been done to the house in past few years?
                Any ongoing issues? And what might be included in the offer, as well as possible possession dates?

                The owners have lived in the house probably for a long time and therefore have personal knowledge of
                the house and neighborhood. They can tell you useful details about the house and the neighborhood.

                Finally, buyers will benefit from the cost savings of private sale, which is often reflected in a
                lower purchase price. Reasonable owners will be very willing to share this cost savings with the
                buyers.
                </p>
                <h4> <b>Benefits of Private Home Sales for the Seller</b></h4>
                <p>
                    The primary reason people use private sales is, of course, the cost savings. Real estate commissions
                    for a home sale typically range between 3 and 5 percent of the final purchase price. For example,
                    the total commission for $716,828(national average price in Canada as of April 29, 2021) home is
                    about $21,504 to $35,840. This is the money that seller never sees. The commission typically is
                    split between the seller's agent and the buyer's agent. Buyer's agent normally get a bigger chink of
                    this.

                    Private home sales are getting easier all the time. As the Internet and its capabilities expand, so
                    do the opportunities for online browsing of real estate. Owners selling their homes have many online
                    resources for listing their properties and getting help with the selling process.

                <h4> <b>What should you think before doing private sale?</b></h4>

                Every real estate transaction go through the seller's and buyer's lawyers. It is the lawyers who
                ensure that everything is done properly and that both parties are equally protected under the law.

                Whether you go through the private sale or end up paying real estate agents(for a buyer) or end up
                paying more for a house(for a seller), just make sure that you go through all the inspections and
                that you feel righ about the sale or purchase. .
